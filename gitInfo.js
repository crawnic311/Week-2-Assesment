/*
    For this section of the assessment you will be putting together a cheat sheet for common git commands.  
    You'll provide the command as well as what it does.

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable called 'gitDefinition'.
    It should be a string containing your best definition of what Git is.

//CODE HERE
let gitDefinition = "Git is a software that developers use to track changes they make to the programs they are creating and maintaning";

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////

let gitHubDefinition = "GitHub is a SaaS company that helps developers share their version histories when using git. It's like google drive where docs and sheets can be shared, except github is primarily used for git."

//////////////////PROBLEMS 3 - 8////////////////////
/*
    For the next several problems you will be creating objects containing information about different git 
    commands.  Each object should contain 'description' and 'code' properties.  The 'description' property 
    will be a string with a description of what that git command does.  The 'code' property should be a 
    string of the actual command (what you type into your terminal).
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'init' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the init command.

//CODE HERE
const init = {
    description: 'git init initilizes or creates a new git repository on your local computer',

//////////////////PROBLEM 5////////////////////
/*

*/

//CODE HERE
const status = {
    description: 'git status shows you which branch you are on, whether that branch is up to date, and which files have been modified and not pushed as well as files that are not being tracked at all',
    code: 'git status',
}

//////////////////PROBLEM 6////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'add' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the add command.
*/

//CODE HERE
let add = {
    description: 'git add adds the specified file into your local git repository. It also sets the stage for your next git commit, allowing you to push the file to github.',

*/

//CODE HERE
let commit = {
